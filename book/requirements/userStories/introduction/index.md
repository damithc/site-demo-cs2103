#### Introduction to User Stories

<div id="main">

<tip-box type="primary">
<include src="../../../common/Definitions.md#def-user-story" />
</tip-box>

**A common format** for writing user stories is:

<tip-box type="primary">
<include src="../../../common/Definitions.md#def-user-story-format" />
</tip-box>

<tip-box>
Examples (from a Learning Management System):

1. As a student, I can download files uploaded by lecturers, so that I can get my own copy of the files
2. As a lecturer, I can create discussion forums, so that students can discuss things online
3. As a tutor, I can print attendance sheets, so that I can take attendance during the class

</tip-box>

**We can write user stories on** index cards or sticky notes, and arrange on walls or tables, to facilitate planning and discussion. Alternatively, we can use a software such as [GitHub Project Boards](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) to manage user stories digitally.
